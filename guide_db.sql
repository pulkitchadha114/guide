Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth! Everything from time immemorial to present day is at my fingertips! I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me? The feng shui here is obviously a killing layout of Nine Yin Repudiation! Look at the bronze mirror facing the bed! Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me. Did no one get a feng shui master when they decorated the room?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As its name indicated, Nine Yin Repudiation was a feng shui layout that collected negative energy and spirits. If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away. However, it seemed nailed to the wall and didn&rsquo;t budge no matter how he put his back into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The sight of something in the mirror shocked him out of his wits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a reflection of a youth, roughly sixteen years of age, with sculpturesque features and clear, fair skin. He looked like a perfect dandy, if not for the wan complexion that was devoid of any color. He also looked uncommonly frail, like a gust of wind would blow him away at any time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is definitely not me!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&hellip;is it an illusion?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun raised his hand, a motion mirrored by the handsome fellow in the mirror. He shook his head, once more copied by the young man in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun crashed to the floor again. &ldquo;Bloody hell, that&rsquo;s not me at all! What the freaking hell is going on??&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely flabbergasted, his mind raced furiously through his shock. He carefully recounted the events that had occurred one second prior to him falling comatose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t seem to have made it out of that certain death layout. Then I should be dead, but reborn thanks to this youth&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; He could recall the agony of despair at the moment of his death. &ldquo;Then, did that girl speak the truth? Is this a world of immortals, and the young man who I&rsquo;ve come back to life in really some kind of governor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Immortal world, world of immortals&hellip; so that means I&rsquo;m an immortal??&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed and he flung himself into the air, imitating a carp leaping out of water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crack!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He&rsquo;d thrown his back out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun laid dumbly on the floor, unable to move a finger. What the hell kind of immortal was he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, what happened to you, milord??&rdquo; Wanfeng reentered the room and quickly helped the petrified Lu Yun up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I threw my back out.&rdquo; He held his waist up. &ldquo;I, a right and proper celestial being, threw my back out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Threw your back out?&rdquo; Wanfeng blinked, her expression dimming. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, milord. If you really are a god, why would His Majesty the Celestial Emperor want to depose you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She helped Lu Yun to the bed as she spoke. Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body? The host&rsquo;s death was the reason for his second chance at life!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. This servant will still remain by your side even if you&rsquo;re not the governor. I am in the core realm and can deploy combat arts. Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage. Though there weren&rsquo;t many members, its businesses and networks stretched far. It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous. There were no lows it wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to and nothing it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lu Yun&rsquo;s grandfather and father were particularly notorious for their villainy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And perhaps because of all of the sins they&rsquo;d committed, they&rsquo;d both died during their heavenly tribulations. Lu Yun himself was cursed with a dormant bloodline that left him unable to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though he couldn&rsquo;t be a cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t fall behind his old man or grandfather at all when it came to immoral notches on his belt. In fact, he even outshone them at times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Dusk cultivators hated House Lu with a passion. But as the clan of the governor of the province, the house had plenty of experts beneath its banners. Hence, seething quietly beneath the table was all they could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, all that changed three days ago, when the Celestial Emperor of Nephrite Major issued a decree that if the new Governor of Dusk, Lu Yun, was unable to walk the path of cultivation within half a year, he would be stripped of his position. Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue? Where is he?&rdquo; Lu Yun frowned. Was there someone in the same field of work as him in the world of immortals? The layout in this room had been blatantly fatal feng shui that would kill without a single trace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had been able to come back to life in the body of another precisely because the Lu Yun of this world had died to the Nine Yin Repudiation. If he took up long term residence in this room, he would follow in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a first-class tomb raider, Lu Yun had a handle on everything from pinpointing the true location of the coffin in a tomb&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-8319\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-8319\">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;to assessing the overall feng shui of the crypt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The formation of the governor&rsquo;s manor needs maintenance, so Grand Steward Xue went out a few days ago to purchase the foundation stones for the formation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Formation?&rdquo; Lu Yun blinked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Steward Xue is a formation master. There&rsquo;s a defensive one in your room. The grand steward specially set it up because you have many enemies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. Formations of the immortal world? Feng shui layouts?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Help me up for a look.&rdquo; He took a deep breath in, still feeling a bit weak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Wanfeng reached out with a pair of fair, tender hands to help her master up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Lu Yun felt her soft, pliable body, his heart lurched.</p>', NULL, '1666341716_banner_63525b54e0bce1.png', 'this-chapter-is-inside-graphic-design-book', 'published', 'page', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-21 04:35:41', '2022-10-21 05:29:38', 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 229, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0),
(232, 'GRAPHIC DESIGN Chapter-1', NULL, NULL, '<p dir=\"ltr\">The world of immortals, Dusk Province.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun bounced upright in bed, panting heavily with cold sweat beading his forehead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Motherf*cker! Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth! Everything from time immemorial to present day is at my fingertips! I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me? The feng shui here is obviously a killing layout of Nine Yin Repudiation! Look at the bronze mirror facing the bed! Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me. Did no one get a feng shui master when they decorated the room?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As its name indicated, Nine Yin Repudiation was a feng shui layout that collected negative energy and spirits. If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away.

She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body?

The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage. Though there weren&rsquo;t many members, its businesses and networks stretched far. It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous.

Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth! Everything from time immemorial to present day is at my fingertips! I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me? The feng shui here is obviously a killing layout of Nine Yin Repudiation! Look at the bronze mirror facing the bed! Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me. Did no one get a feng shui master when they decorated the room?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As its name indicated, Nine Yin Repudiation was a feng shui layout that collected negative energy and spirits. If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away. However, it seemed nailed to the wall and didn&rsquo;t budge no matter how he put his back into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The sight of something in the mirror shocked him out of his wits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a reflection of a youth, roughly sixteen years of age, with sculpturesque features and clear, fair skin. He looked like a perfect dandy, if not for the wan complexion that was devoid of any color. He also looked uncommonly frail, like a gust of wind would blow him away at any time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is definitely not me!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&hellip;is it an illusion?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun raised his hand, a motion mirrored by the handsome fellow in the mirror. He shook his head, once more copied by the young man in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun crashed to the floor again. &ldquo;Bloody hell, that&rsquo;s not me at all! What the freaking hell is going on??&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely flabbergasted, his mind raced furiously through his shock. He carefully recounted the events that had occurred one second prior to him falling comatose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t seem to have made it out of that certain death layout. Then I should be dead, but reborn thanks to this youth&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; He could recall the agony of despair at the moment of his death. &ldquo;Then, did that girl speak the truth? Is this a world of immortals, and the young man who I&rsquo;ve come back to life in really some kind of governor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Immortal world, world of immortals&hellip; so that means I&rsquo;m an immortal??&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed and he flung himself into the air, imitating a carp leaping out of water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crack!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He&rsquo;d thrown his back out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun laid dumbly on the floor, unable to move a finger. What the hell kind of immortal was he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, what happened to you, milord??&rdquo; Wanfeng reentered the room and quickly helped the petrified Lu Yun up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I threw my back out.&rdquo; He held his waist up. &ldquo;I, a right and proper celestial being, threw my back out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Threw your back out?&rdquo; Wanfeng blinked, her expression dimming. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, milord. If you really are a god, why would His Majesty the Celestial Emperor want to depose you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She helped Lu Yun to the bed as she spoke. Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body? The host&rsquo;s death was the reason for his second chance at life!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. This servant will still remain by your side even if you&rsquo;re not the governor. I am in the core realm and can deploy combat arts. Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage. Though there weren&rsquo;t many members, its businesses and networks stretched far. It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous. There were no lows it wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to and nothing it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lu Yun&rsquo;s grandfather and father were particularly notorious for their villainy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And perhaps because of all of the sins they&rsquo;d committed, they&rsquo;d both died during their heavenly tribulations. Lu Yun himself was cursed with a dormant bloodline that left him unable to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though he couldn&rsquo;t be a cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t fall behind his old man or grandfather at all when it came to immoral notches on his belt. In fact, he even outshone them at times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Dusk cultivators hated House Lu with a passion. But as the clan of the governor of the province, the house had plenty of experts beneath its banners. Hence, seething quietly beneath the table was all they could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, all that changed three days ago, when the Celestial Emperor of Nephrite Major issued a decree that if the new Governor of Dusk, Lu Yun, was unable to walk the path of cultivation within half a year, he would be stripped of his position. Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue? Where is he?&rdquo; Lu Yun frowned. Was there someone in the same field of work as him in the world of immortals? The layout in this room had been blatantly fatal feng shui that would kill without a single trace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had been able to come back to life in the body of another precisely because the Lu Yun of this world had died to the Nine Yin Repudiation. If he took up long term residence in this room, he would follow in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a first-class tomb raider, Lu Yun had a handle on everything from pinpointing the true location of the coffin in a tomb&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-8319\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-8319\">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;to assessing the overall feng shui of the crypt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The formation of the governor&rsquo;s manor needs maintenance, so Grand Steward Xue went out a few days ago to purchase the foundation stones for the formation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Formation?&rdquo; Lu Yun blinked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.

I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away. However, it seemed nailed to the wall and didn&rsquo;t budge no matter how he put his back into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The sight of something in the mirror shocked him out of his wits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a reflection of a youth, roughly sixteen years of age, with sculpturesque features and clear, fair skin. He looked like a perfect dandy, if not for the wan complexion that was devoid of any color. He also looked uncommonly frail, like a gust of wind would blow him away at any time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is definitely not me!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&hellip;is it an illusion?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun raised his hand, a motion mirrored by the handsome fellow in the mirror. He shook his head, once more copied by the young man in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun crashed to the floor again. &ldquo;Bloody hell, that&rsquo;s not me at all! What the freaking hell is going on??&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely flabbergasted, his mind raced furiously through his shock. He carefully recounted the events that had occurred one second prior to him falling comatose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t seem to have made it out of that certain death layout. Then I should be dead, but reborn thanks to this youth&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; He could recall the agony of despair at the moment of his death. &ldquo;Then, did that girl speak the truth? Is this a world of immortals, and the young man who I&rsquo;ve come back to life in really some kind of governor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Immortal world, world of immortals&hellip; so that means I&rsquo;m an immortal??&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed and he flung himself into the air, imitating a carp leaping out of water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crack!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He&rsquo;d thrown his back out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun laid dumbly on the floor, unable to move a finger. What the hell kind of immortal was he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, what happened to you, milord??&rdquo; Wanfeng reentered the room and quickly helped the petrified Lu Yun up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I threw my back out.&rdquo; He held his waist up. &ldquo;I, a right and proper celestial being, threw my back out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Threw your back out?&rdquo; Wanfeng blinked, her expression dimming. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, milord. If you really are a god, why would His Majesty the Celestial Emperor want to depose you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She helped Lu Yun to the bed as she spoke. Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body? The host&rsquo;s death was the reason for his second chance at life!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. This servant will still remain by your side even if you&rsquo;re not the governor. I am in the core realm and can deploy combat arts. Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage. Though there weren&rsquo;t many members, its businesses and networks stretched far. It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous. There were no lows it wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to and nothing it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lu Yun&rsquo;s grandfather and father were particularly notorious for their villainy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And perhaps because of all of the sins they&rsquo;d committed, they&rsquo;d both died during their heavenly tribulations. Lu Yun himself was cursed with a dormant bloodline that left him unable to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though he couldn&rsquo;t be a cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t fall behind his old man or grandfather at all when it came to immoral notches on his belt. In fact, he even outshone them at times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Dusk cultivators hated House Lu with a passion. But as the clan of the governor of the province, the house had plenty of experts beneath its banners. Hence, seething quietly beneath the table was all they could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, all that changed three days ago, when the Celestial Emperor of Nephrite Major issued a decree that if the new Governor of Dusk, Lu Yun, was unable to walk the path of cultivation within half a year, he would be stripped of his position. Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue? Where is he?&rdquo; Lu Yun frowned. Was there someone in the same field of work as him in the world of immortals? The layout in this room had been blatantly fatal feng shui that would kill without a single trace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had been able to come back to life in the body of another precisely because the Lu Yun of this world had died to the Nine Yin Repudiation. If he took up long term residence in this room, he would follow in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a first-class tomb raider, Lu Yun had a handle on everything from pinpointing the true location of the coffin in a tomb&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-8319\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-8319\">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;to assessing the overall feng shui of the crypt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The formation of the governor&rsquo;s manor needs maintenance, so Grand Steward Xue went out a few days ago to purchase the foundation stones for the formation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Formation?&rdquo; Lu Yun blinked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Steward Xue is a formation master. There&rsquo;s a defensive one in your room. The grand steward specially set it up because you have many enemies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. Formations of the immortal world? Feng shui layouts?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Help me up for a look.&rdquo; He took a deep breath in, still feeling a bit weak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Wanfeng reached out with a pair of fair, tender hands to help her master up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Lu Yun felt her soft, pliable body, his heart lurched.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"footnote-2b6f\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', NULL, '1666345188_banner_635268e4358501.jpeg', 'video-graphy', 'published', 'category', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-21 05:39:48', NULL, 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 227, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0);

Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth! Everything from time immemorial to present day is at my fingertips! I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me? The feng shui here is obviously a killing layout of Nine Yin Repudiation! Look at the bronze mirror facing the bed! Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me. Did no one get a feng shui master when they decorated the room?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As its name indicated, Nine Yin Repudiation was a feng shui layout that collected negative energy and spirits. If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away.

There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue? Where is he?&rdquo; Lu Yun frowned. Was there someone in the same field of work as him in the world of immortals? The layout in this room had been blatantly fatal feng shui that would kill without a single trace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had been able to come back to life in the body of another precisely because the Lu Yun of this world had died to the Nine Yin Repudiation. If he took up long term residence in this room, he would follow in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a first-class tomb raider, Lu Yun had a handle on everything from pinpointing the true location of the coffin in a tomb&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-8319\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-8319\">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;to assessing the overall feng shui of the crypt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The formation of the governor&rsquo;s manor needs maintenance, so Grand Steward Xue went out a few days ago to purchase the foundation stones for the formation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Formation?&rdquo; Lu Yun blinked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Steward Xue is a formation master. There&rsquo;s a defensive one in your room. The grand steward specially set it up because you have many enemies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. Formations of the immortal world? Feng shui layouts?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Help me up for a look.&rdquo; He took a deep breath in, still feeling a bit weak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Wanfeng reached out with a pair of fair, tender hands to help her master up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Lu Yun felt her soft, pliable body, his heart lurched.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"footnote-2b6f\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', NULL, '1666345221_banner_63526905aad4b1.jpeg', 'tv-commercials', 'published', 'category', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-21 05:40:21', NULL, 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 227, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth! Everything from time immemorial to present day is at my fingertips! I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me? The feng shui here is obviously a killing layout of Nine Yin Repudiation! Look at the bronze mirror facing the bed! Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me. Did no one get a feng shui master when they decorated the room?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As its name indicated, Nine Yin Repudiation was a feng shui layout that collected negative energy and spirits. If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away. However, it seemed nailed to the wall and didn&rsquo;t budge no matter how he put his back into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The sight of something in the mirror shocked him out of his wits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a reflection of a youth, roughly sixteen years of age, with sculpturesque features and clear, fair skin. He looked like a perfect dandy, if not for the wan complexion that was devoid of any color. He also looked uncommonly frail, like a gust of wind would blow him away at any time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is definitely not me!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&hellip;is it an illusion?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun raised his hand, a motion mirrored by the handsome fellow in the mirror. He shook his head, once more copied by the young man in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun crashed to the floor again. &ldquo;Bloody hell, that&rsquo;s not me at all! What the freaking hell is going on??&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely flabbergasted, his mind raced furiously through his shock. He carefully recounted the events that had occurred one second prior to him falling comatose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t seem to have made it out of that certain death layout. Then I should be dead, but reborn thanks to this youth&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; He could recall the agony of despair at the moment of his death. &ldquo;Then, did that girl speak the truth? Is this a world of immortals, and the young man who I&rsquo;ve come back to life in really some kind of governor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Immortal world, world of immortals&hellip; so that means I&rsquo;m an immortal??&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed and he flung himself into the air, imitating a carp leaping out of water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crack!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He&rsquo;d thrown his back out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun laid dumbly on the floor, unable to move a finger. What the hell kind of immortal was he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, what happened to you, milord??&rdquo; Wanfeng reentered the room and quickly helped the petrified Lu Yun up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I threw my back out.&rdquo; He held his waist up. &ldquo;I, a right and proper celestial being, threw my back out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Threw your back out?&rdquo; Wanfeng blinked, her expression dimming. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, milord. If you really are a god, why would His Majesty the Celestial Emperor want to depose you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She helped Lu Yun to the bed as she spoke. Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body? The host&rsquo;s death was the reason for his second chance at life!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. This servant will still remain by your side even if you&rsquo;re not the governor. I am in the core realm and can deploy combat arts. Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage. Though there weren&rsquo;t many members, its businesses and networks stretched far. It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous. There were no lows it wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to and nothing it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lu Yun&rsquo;s grandfather and father were particularly notorious for their villainy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And perhaps because of all of the sins they&rsquo;d committed, they&rsquo;d both died during their heavenly tribulations. Lu Yun himself was cursed with a dormant bloodline that left him unable to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though he couldn&rsquo;t be a cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t fall behind his old man or grandfather at all when it came to immoral notches on his belt. In fact, he even outshone them at times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Dusk cultivators hated House Lu with a passion. But as the clan of the governor of the province, the house had plenty of experts beneath its banners. Hence, seething quietly beneath the table was all they could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, all that changed three days ago, when the Celestial Emperor of Nephrite Major issued a decree that if the new Governor of Dusk, Lu Yun, was unable to walk the path of cultivation within half a year, he would be stripped of his position. Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate.

Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away. However, it seemed nailed to the wall and didn&rsquo;t budge no matter how he put his back into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The sight of something in the mirror shocked him out of his wits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a reflection of a youth, roughly sixteen years of age, with sculpturesque features and clear, fair skin. He looked like a perfect dandy, if not for the wan complexion that was devoid of any color. He also looked uncommonly frail, like a gust of wind would blow him away at any time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is definitely not me!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&hellip;is it an illusion?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun raised his hand, a motion mirrored by the handsome fellow in the mirror. He shook his head, once more copied by the young man in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun crashed to the floor again. &ldquo;Bloody hell, that&rsquo;s not me at all! What the freaking hell is going on??&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely flabbergasted, his mind raced furiously through his shock. He carefully recounted the events that had occurred one second prior to him falling comatose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t seem to have made it out of that certain death layout. Then I should be dead, but reborn thanks to this youth&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; He could recall the agony of despair at the moment of his death. &ldquo;Then, did that girl speak the truth? Is this a world of immortals, and the young man who I&rsquo;ve come back to life in really some kind of governor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Immortal world, world of immortals&hellip; so that means I&rsquo;m an immortal??&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed and he flung himself into the air, imitating a carp leaping out of water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crack!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He&rsquo;d thrown his back out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun laid dumbly on the floor, unable to move a finger. What the hell kind of immortal was he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, what happened to you, milord??&rdquo; Wanfeng reentered the room and quickly helped the petrified Lu Yun up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I threw my back out.&rdquo; He held his waist up. &ldquo;I, a right and proper celestial being, threw my back out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Threw your back out?&rdquo; Wanfeng blinked, her expression dimming. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, milord. If you really are a god, why would His Majesty the Celestial Emperor want to depose you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She helped Lu Yun to the bed as she spoke. Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body? The host&rsquo;s death was the reason for his second chance at life!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. This servant will still remain by your side even if you&rsquo;re not the governor. I am in the core realm and can deploy combat arts. Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage. Though there weren&rsquo;t many members, its businesses and networks stretched far. It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous. There were no lows it wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to and nothing it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lu Yun&rsquo;s grandfather and father were particularly notorious for their villainy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And perhaps because of all of the sins they&rsquo;d committed, they&rsquo;d both died during their heavenly tribulations. Lu Yun himself was cursed with a dormant bloodline that left him unable to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though he couldn&rsquo;t be a cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t fall behind his old man or grandfather at all when it came to immoral notches on his belt. In fact, he even outshone them at times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Dusk cultivators hated House Lu with a passion. But as the clan of the governor of the province, the house had plenty of experts beneath its banners. Hence, seething quietly beneath the table was all they could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, all that changed three days ago, when the Celestial Emperor of Nephrite Major issued a decree that if the new Governor of Dusk, Lu Yun, was unable to walk the path of cultivation within half a year, he would be stripped of his position. Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue? Where is he?&rdquo; Lu Yun frowned. Was there someone in the same field of work as him in the world of immortals? The layout in this room had been blatantly fatal feng shui that would kill without a single trace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had been able to come back to life in the body of another precisely because the Lu Yun of this world had died to the Nine Yin Repudiation. If he took up long term residence in this room, he would follow in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a first-class tomb raider, Lu Yun had a handle on everything from pinpointing the true location of the coffin in a tomb&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-8319\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-8319\">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;to assessing the overall feng shui of the crypt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The formation of the governor&rsquo;s manor needs maintenance, so Grand Steward Xue went out a few days ago to purchase the foundation stones for the formation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Formation?&rdquo; Lu Yun blinked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Steward Xue is a formation master. There&rsquo;s a defensive one in your room. The grand steward specially set it up because you have many enemies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. Formations of the immortal world? Feng shui layouts?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Help me up for a look.&rdquo; He took a deep breath in, still feeling a bit weak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Wanfeng reached out with a pair of fair, tender hands to help her master up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Lu Yun felt her soft, pliable body, his heart lurched.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"footnote-2b6f\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', NULL, '1666345349_banner_6352698509faf1.jpg', 'lu-yun-rubbed', 'published', 'category', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-21 05:42:29', NULL, 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 225, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth! Everything from time immemorial to present day is at my fingertips! I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me? The feng shui here is obviously a killing layout of Nine Yin Repudiation! Look at the bronze mirror facing the bed! Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me. Did no one get a feng shui master when they decorated the room?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As its name indicated, Nine Yin Repudiation was a feng shui layout that collected negative energy and spirits. If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor.

I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears.

Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue? Where is he?&rdquo; Lu Yun frowned. Was there someone in the same field of work as him in the world of immortals? The layout in this room had been blatantly fatal feng shui that would kill without a single trace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had been able to come back to life in the body of another precisely because the Lu Yun of this world had died to the Nine Yin Repudiation. If he took up long term residence in this room, he would follow in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a first-class tomb raider, Lu Yun had a handle on everything from pinpointing the true location of the coffin in a tomb&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-8319\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-8319\">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;to assessing the overall feng shui of the crypt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The formation of the governor&rsquo;s manor needs maintenance, so Grand Steward Xue went out a few days ago to purchase the foundation stones for the formation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Formation?&rdquo; Lu Yun blinked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Steward Xue is a formation master. There&rsquo;s a defensive one in your room. The grand steward specially set it up because you have many enemies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. Formations of the immortal world? Feng shui layouts?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Help me up for a look.&rdquo; He took a deep breath in, still feeling a bit weak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Wanfeng reached out with a pair of fair, tender hands to help her master up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Lu Yun felt her soft, pliable body, his heart lurched.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"footnote-2b6f\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', NULL, '1666345395_banner_635269b31c1b11.jpeg', 'deep-breath', 'published', 'category', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-21 05:43:15', NULL, 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 225, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0);

Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth! Everything from time immemorial to present day is at my fingertips! I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me? The feng shui here is obviously a killing layout of Nine Yin Repudiation! Look at the bronze mirror facing the bed! Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me. Did no one get a feng shui master when they decorated the room?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As its name indicated, Nine Yin Repudiation was a feng shui layout that collected negative energy and spirits. If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away. However, it seemed nailed to the wall and didn&rsquo;t budge no matter how he put his back into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The sight of something in the mirror shocked him out of his wits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a reflection of a youth, roughly sixteen years of age, with sculpturesque features and clear, fair skin. He looked like a perfect dandy, if not for the wan complexion that was devoid of any color. He also looked uncommonly frail, like a gust of wind would blow him away at any time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is definitely not me!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&hellip;is it an illusion?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun raised his hand, a motion mirrored by the handsome fellow in the mirror. He shook his head, once more copied by the young man in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun crashed to the floor again. &ldquo;Bloody hell, that&rsquo;s not me at all! What the freaking hell is going on??&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely flabbergasted, his mind raced furiously through his shock. He carefully recounted the events that had occurred one second prior to him falling comatose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t seem to have made it out of that certain death layout. Then I should be dead, but reborn thanks to this youth&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; He could recall the agony of despair at the moment of his death. &ldquo;Then, did that girl speak the truth? Is this a world of immortals, and the young man who I&rsquo;ve come back to life in really some kind of governor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Immortal world, world of immortals&hellip; so that means I&rsquo;m an immortal??&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed and he flung himself into the air, imitating a carp leaping out of water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crack!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He&rsquo;d thrown his back out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun laid dumbly on the floor, unable to move a finger. What the hell kind of immortal was he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, what happened to you, milord??&rdquo; Wanfeng reentered the room and quickly helped the petrified Lu Yun up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I threw my back out.&rdquo; He held his waist up. &ldquo;I, a right and proper celestial being, threw my back out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Threw your back out?&rdquo; Wanfeng blinked, her expression dimming. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, milord. If you really are a god, why would His Majesty the Celestial Emperor want to depose you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She helped Lu Yun to the bed as she spoke. Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body? The host&rsquo;s death was the reason for his second chance at life!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. This servant will still remain by your side even if you&rsquo;re not the governor. I am in the core realm and can deploy combat arts. Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage. Though there weren&rsquo;t many members, its businesses and networks stretched far. It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous. There were no lows it wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to and nothing it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lu Yun&rsquo;s grandfather and father were particularly notorious for their villainy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And perhaps because of all of the sins they&rsquo;d committed, they&rsquo;d both died during their heavenly tribulations. Lu Yun himself was cursed with a dormant bloodline that left him unable to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though he couldn&rsquo;t be a cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t fall behind his old man or grandfather at all when it came to immoral notches on his belt. In fact, he even outshone them at times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Dusk cultivators hated House Lu with a passion. But as the clan of the governor of the province, the house had plenty of experts beneath its banners. Hence, seething quietly beneath the table was all they could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, all that changed three days ago, when the Celestial Emperor of Nephrite Major issued a decree that if the new Governor of Dusk, Lu Yun, was unable to walk the path of cultivation within half a year, he would be stripped of his position. Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue?

A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away. However, it seemed nailed to the wall and didn&rsquo;t budge no matter how he put his back into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The sight of something in the mirror shocked him out of his wits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a reflection of a youth, roughly sixteen years of age, with sculpturesque features and clear, fair skin. He looked like a perfect dandy, if not for the wan complexion that was devoid of any color. He also looked uncommonly frail, like a gust of wind would blow him away at any time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is definitely not me!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&hellip;is it an illusion?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun raised his hand, a motion mirrored by the handsome fellow in the mirror. He shook his head, once more copied by the young man in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun crashed to the floor again. &ldquo;Bloody hell, that&rsquo;s not me at all! What the freaking hell is going on??&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely flabbergasted, his mind raced furiously through his shock. He carefully recounted the events that had occurred one second prior to him falling comatose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t seem to have made it out of that certain death layout. Then I should be dead, but reborn thanks to this youth&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; He could recall the agony of despair at the moment of his death. &ldquo;Then, did that girl speak the truth? Is this a world of immortals, and the young man who I&rsquo;ve come back to life in really some kind of governor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Immortal world, world of immortals&hellip; so that means I&rsquo;m an immortal??&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed and he flung himself into the air, imitating a carp leaping out of water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crack!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He&rsquo;d thrown his back out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun laid dumbly on the floor, unable to move a finger. What the hell kind of immortal was he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, what happened to you, milord??&rdquo; Wanfeng reentered the room and quickly helped the petrified Lu Yun up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I threw my back out.&rdquo; He held his waist up. &ldquo;I, a right and proper celestial being, threw my back out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Threw your back out?&rdquo; Wanfeng blinked, her expression dimming. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, milord. If you really are a god, why would His Majesty the Celestial Emperor want to depose you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She helped Lu Yun to the bed as she spoke. Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body? The host&rsquo;s death was the reason for his second chance at life!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. This servant will still remain by your side even if you&rsquo;re not the governor. I am in the core realm and can deploy combat arts. Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage. Though there weren&rsquo;t many members, its businesses and networks stretched far. It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous. There were no lows it wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to and nothing it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lu Yun&rsquo;s grandfather and father were particularly notorious for their villainy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And perhaps because of all of the sins they&rsquo;d committed, they&rsquo;d both died during their heavenly tribulations. Lu Yun himself was cursed with a dormant bloodline that left him unable to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though he couldn&rsquo;t be a cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t fall behind his old man or grandfather at all when it came to immoral notches on his belt. In fact, he even outshone them at times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Dusk cultivators hated House Lu with a passion. But as the clan of the governor of the province, the house had plenty of experts beneath its banners. Hence, seething quietly beneath the table was all they could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, all that changed three days ago, when the Celestial Emperor of Nephrite Major issued a decree that if the new Governor of Dusk, Lu Yun, was unable to walk the path of cultivation within half a year, he would be stripped of his position. Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue? Where is he?&rdquo; Lu Yun frowned. Was there someone in the same field of work as him in the world of immortals? The layout in this room had been blatantly fatal feng shui that would kill without a single trace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had been able to come back to life in the body of another precisely because the Lu Yun of this world had died to the Nine Yin Repudiation. If he took up long term residence in this room, he would follow in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a first-class tomb raider, Lu Yun had a handle on everything from pinpointing the true location of the coffin in a tomb&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-8319\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-8319\">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;to assessing the overall feng shui of the crypt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The formation of the governor&rsquo;s manor needs maintenance, so Grand Steward Xue went out a few days ago to purchase the foundation stones for the formation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Formation?&rdquo; Lu Yun blinked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Steward Xue is a formation master. There&rsquo;s a defensive one in your room. The grand steward specially set it up because you have many enemies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. Formations of the immortal world? Feng shui layouts?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Help me up for a look.&rdquo; He took a deep breath in, still feeling a bit weak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Wanfeng reached out with a pair of fair, tender hands to help her master up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Lu Yun felt her soft, pliable body, his heart lurched.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"footnote-2b6f\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', NULL, '1666345522_banner_63526a3249ebf1.jpg', 'steward-xue', 'published', 'category', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-21 05:45:22', NULL, 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 223, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0);

Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth! Everything from time immemorial to present day is at my fingertips! I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me? The feng shui here is obviously a killing layout of Nine Yin Repudiation! Look at the bronze mirror facing the bed! Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me. Did no one get a feng shui master when they decorated the room?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As its name indicated, Nine Yin Repudiation was a feng shui layout that collected negative energy and spirits. If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me?

This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears.

It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous. There were no lows it wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to and nothing it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lu Yun&rsquo;s grandfather and father were particularly notorious for their villainy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And perhaps because of all of the sins they&rsquo;d committed, they&rsquo;d both died during their heavenly tribulations. Lu Yun himself was cursed with a dormant bloodline that left him unable to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though he couldn&rsquo;t be a cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t fall behind his old man or grandfather at all when it came to immoral notches on his belt. In fact, he even outshone them at times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Dusk cultivators hated House Lu with a passion. But as the clan of the governor of the province, the house had plenty of experts beneath its banners. Hence, seething quietly beneath the table was all they could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, all that changed three days ago, when the Celestial Emperor of Nephrite Major issued a decree that if the new Governor of Dusk, Lu Yun, was unable to walk the path of cultivation within half a year, he would be stripped of his position. Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue? Where is he?&rdquo; Lu Yun frowned. Was there someone in the same field of work as him in the world of immortals? The layout in this room had been blatantly fatal feng shui that would kill without a single trace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had been able to come back to life in the body of another precisely because the Lu Yun of this world had died to the Nine Yin Repudiation. If he took up long term residence in this room, he would follow in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a first-class tomb raider, Lu Yun had a handle on everything from pinpointing the true location of the coffin in a tomb&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-8319\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-8319\">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;to assessing the overall feng shui of the crypt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The formation of the governor&rsquo;s manor needs maintenance, so Grand Steward Xue went out a few days ago to purchase the foundation stones for the formation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Formation?&rdquo; Lu Yun blinked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Steward Xue is a formation master. There&rsquo;s a defensive one in your room. The grand steward specially set it up because you have many enemies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. Formations of the immortal world? Feng shui layouts?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Help me up for a look.&rdquo; He took a deep breath in, still feeling a bit weak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Wanfeng reached out with a pair of fair, tender hands to help her master up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Lu Yun felt her soft, pliable body, his heart lurched.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"footnote-2b6f\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', NULL, '1666345557_banner_63526a55cfc531.jpeg', 'lu-yun', 'published', 'category', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-21 05:45:57', NULL, 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 223, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth! Everything from time immemorial to present day is at my fingertips! I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me? The feng shui here is obviously a killing layout of Nine Yin Repudiation! Look at the bronze mirror facing the bed! Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me. Did no one get a feng shui master when they decorated the room?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As its name indicated, Nine Yin Repudiation was a feng shui layout that collected negative energy and spirits. If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away. However, it seemed nailed to the wall and didn&rsquo;t budge no matter how he put his back into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The sight of something in the mirror shocked him out of his wits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a reflection of a youth, roughly sixteen years of age, with sculpturesque features and clear, fair skin. He looked like a perfect dandy, if not for the wan complexion that was devoid of any color. He also looked uncommonly frail, like a gust of wind would blow him away at any time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is definitely not me!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&hellip;is it an illusion?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun raised his hand, a motion mirrored by the handsome fellow in the mirror. He shook his head, once more copied by the young man in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun crashed to the floor again. &ldquo;Bloody hell, that&rsquo;s not me at all! What the freaking hell is going on??&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely flabbergasted, his mind raced furiously through his shock. He carefully recounted the events that had occurred one second prior to him falling comatose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t seem to have made it out of that certain death layout. Then I should be dead, but reborn thanks to this youth&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; He could recall the agony of despair at the moment of his death. &ldquo;Then, did that girl speak the truth? Is this a world of immortals, and the young man who I&rsquo;ve come back to life in really some kind of governor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Immortal world, world of immortals&hellip; so that means I&rsquo;m an immortal??&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed and he flung himself into the air, imitating a carp leaping out of water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crack!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He&rsquo;d thrown his back out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun laid dumbly on the floor, unable to move a finger. What the hell kind of immortal was he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, what happened to you, milord??&rdquo; Wanfeng reentered the room and quickly helped the petrified Lu Yun up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I threw my back out.&rdquo; He held his waist up. &ldquo;I, a right and proper celestial being, threw my back out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Threw your back out?&rdquo; Wanfeng blinked, her expression dimming. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, milord. If you really are a god, why would His Majesty the Celestial Emperor want to depose you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She helped Lu Yun to the bed as she spoke. Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body? The host&rsquo;s death was the reason for his second chance at life!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. This servant will still remain by your side even if you&rsquo;re not the governor. I am in the core realm and can deploy combat arts. Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage.

If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away. However, it seemed nailed to the wall and didn&rsquo;t budge no matter how he put his back into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The sight of something in the mirror shocked him out of his wits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a reflection of a youth, roughly sixteen years of age, with sculpturesque features and clear, fair skin. He looked like a perfect dandy, if not for the wan complexion that was devoid of any color. He also looked uncommonly frail, like a gust of wind would blow him away at any time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is definitely not me!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&hellip;is it an illusion?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun raised his hand, a motion mirrored by the handsome fellow in the mirror. He shook his head, once more copied by the young man in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun crashed to the floor again. &ldquo;Bloody hell, that&rsquo;s not me at all! What the freaking hell is going on??&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely flabbergasted, his mind raced furiously through his shock. He carefully recounted the events that had occurred one second prior to him falling comatose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t seem to have made it out of that certain death layout. Then I should be dead, but reborn thanks to this youth&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; He could recall the agony of despair at the moment of his death. &ldquo;Then, did that girl speak the truth? Is this a world of immortals, and the young man who I&rsquo;ve come back to life in really some kind of governor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Immortal world, world of immortals&hellip; so that means I&rsquo;m an immortal??&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed and he flung himself into the air, imitating a carp leaping out of water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crack!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He&rsquo;d thrown his back out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun laid dumbly on the floor, unable to move a finger. What the hell kind of immortal was he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, what happened to you, milord??&rdquo; Wanfeng reentered the room and quickly helped the petrified Lu Yun up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I threw my back out.&rdquo; He held his waist up. &ldquo;I, a right and proper celestial being, threw my back out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Threw your back out?&rdquo; Wanfeng blinked, her expression dimming. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, milord. If you really are a god, why would His Majesty the Celestial Emperor want to depose you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She helped Lu Yun to the bed as she spoke. Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body? The host&rsquo;s death was the reason for his second chance at life!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. This servant will still remain by your side even if you&rsquo;re not the governor. I am in the core realm and can deploy combat arts. Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage. Though there weren&rsquo;t many members, its businesses and networks stretched far. It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous. There were no lows it wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to and nothing it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lu Yun&rsquo;s grandfather and father were particularly notorious for their villainy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And perhaps because of all of the sins they&rsquo;d committed, they&rsquo;d both died during their heavenly tribulations. Lu Yun himself was cursed with a dormant bloodline that left him unable to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though he couldn&rsquo;t be a cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t fall behind his old man or grandfather at all when it came to immoral notches on his belt. In fact, he even outshone them at times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Dusk cultivators hated House Lu with a passion. But as the clan of the governor of the province, the house had plenty of experts beneath its banners. Hence, seething quietly beneath the table was all they could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, all that changed three days ago, when the Celestial Emperor of Nephrite Major issued a decree that if the new Governor of Dusk, Lu Yun, was unable to walk the path of cultivation within half a year, he would be stripped of his position. Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue? Where is he?&rdquo; Lu Yun frowned. Was there someone in the same field of work as him in the world of immortals? The layout in this room had been blatantly fatal feng shui that would kill without a single trace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had been able to come back to life in the body of another precisely because the Lu Yun of this world had died to the Nine Yin Repudiation. If he took up long term residence in this room, he would follow in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a first-class tomb raider, Lu Yun had a handle on everything from pinpointing the true location of the coffin in a tomb&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-8319\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-8319\">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;to assessing the overall feng shui of the crypt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The formation of the governor&rsquo;s manor needs maintenance, so Grand Steward Xue went out a few days ago to purchase the foundation stones for the formation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Formation?&rdquo; Lu Yun blinked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Steward Xue is a formation master. There&rsquo;s a defensive one in your room. The grand steward specially set it up because you have many enemies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. Formations of the immortal world? Feng shui layouts?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Help me up for a look.&rdquo; He took a deep breath in, still feeling a bit weak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Wanfeng reached out with a pair of fair, tender hands to help her master up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Lu Yun felt her soft, pliable body, his heart lurched.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"footnote-2b6f\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', NULL, '1666345767_banner_63526b27c110d1.jpg', 'feng-lui', 'published', 'category', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-21 05:49:27', NULL, 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 226, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth! Everything from time immemorial to present day is at my fingertips! I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me? The feng shui here is obviously a killing layout of Nine Yin Repudiation! Look at the bronze mirror facing the bed! Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me.

Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage. Though there weren&rsquo;t many members, its businesses and networks stretched far. It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous. There were no lows it wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to and nothing it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lu Yun&rsquo;s grandfather and father were particularly notorious for their villainy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And perhaps because of all of the sins they&rsquo;d committed, they&rsquo;d both died during their heavenly tribulations. Lu Yun himself was cursed with a dormant bloodline that left him unable to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though he couldn&rsquo;t be a cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t fall behind his old man or grandfather at all when it came to immoral notches on his belt. In fact, he even outshone them at times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Dusk cultivators hated House Lu with a passion. But as the clan of the governor of the province, the house had plenty of experts beneath its banners. Hence, seething quietly beneath the table was all they could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, all that changed three days ago, when the Celestial Emperor of Nephrite Major issued a decree that if the new Governor of Dusk, Lu Yun, was unable to walk the path of cultivation within half a year, he would be stripped of his position. Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue? Where is he?&rdquo; Lu Yun frowned. Was there someone in the same field of work as him in the world of immortals? The layout in this room had been blatantly fatal feng shui that would kill without a single trace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had been able to come back to life in the body of another precisely because the Lu Yun of this world had died to the Nine Yin Repudiation. If he took up long term residence in this room, he would follow in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a first-class tomb raider, Lu Yun had a handle on everything from pinpointing the true location of the coffin in a tomb&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-8319\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-8319\">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;to assessing the overall feng shui of the crypt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The formation of the governor&rsquo;s manor needs maintenance, so Grand Steward Xue went out a few days ago to purchase the foundation stones for the formation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Formation?&rdquo; Lu Yun blinked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Steward Xue is a formation master. There&rsquo;s a defensive one in your room. The grand steward specially set it up because you have many enemies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. Formations of the immortal world? Feng shui layouts?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Help me up for a look.&rdquo; He took a deep breath in, still feeling a bit weak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Wanfeng reached out with a pair of fair, tender hands to help her master up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Lu Yun felt her soft, pliable body, his heart lurched.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"footnote-2b6f\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', NULL, '1666356986_banner_635296facdff91.jpeg', 'youth-governor', 'published', 'category', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-21 08:56:26', NULL, 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 230, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0);

Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth! Everything from time immemorial to present day is at my fingertips! I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me? The feng shui here is obviously a killing layout of Nine Yin Repudiation! Look at the bronze mirror facing the bed! Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me. Did no one get a feng shui master when they decorated the room?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As its name indicated, Nine Yin Repudiation was a feng shui layout that collected negative energy and spirits. If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away. However, it seemed nailed to the wall and didn&rsquo;t budge no matter how he put his back into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The sight of something in the mirror shocked him out of his wits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a reflection of a youth, roughly sixteen years of age, with sculpturesque features and clear, fair skin. He looked like a perfect dandy, if not for the wan complexion that was devoid of any color. He also looked uncommonly frail, like a gust of wind would blow him away at any time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is definitely not me!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&hellip;is it an illusion?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun raised his hand, a motion mirrored by the handsome fellow in the mirror. He shook his head, once more copied by the young man in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun crashed to the floor again. &ldquo;Bloody hell, that&rsquo;s not me at all! What the freaking hell is going on??&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely flabbergasted, his mind raced furiously through his shock. He carefully recounted the events that had occurred one second prior to him falling comatose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t seem to have made it out of that certain death layout. Then I should be dead, but reborn thanks to this youth&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; He could recall the agony of despair at the moment of his death. &ldquo;Then, did that girl speak the truth? Is this a world of immortals, and the young man who I&rsquo;ve come back to life in really some kind of governor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Immortal world, world of immortals&hellip; so that means I&rsquo;m an immortal??&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed and he flung himself into the air, imitating a carp leaping out of water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crack!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He&rsquo;d thrown his back out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun laid dumbly on the floor, unable to move a finger. What the hell kind of immortal was he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, what happened to you, milord??&rdquo; Wanfeng reentered the room and quickly helped the petrified Lu Yun up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I threw my back out.&rdquo; He held his waist up. &ldquo;I, a right and proper celestial being, threw my back out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Threw your back out?&rdquo; Wanfeng blinked, her expression dimming. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, milord. If you really are a god, why would His Majesty the Celestial Emperor want to depose you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She helped Lu Yun to the bed as she spoke. Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body? The host&rsquo;s death was the reason for his second chance at life!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. This servant will still remain by your side even if you&rsquo;re not the governor. I am in the core realm and can deploy combat arts. Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage.

Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me. Did no one get a feng shui master when they decorated the room?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As its name indicated, Nine Yin Repudiation was a feng shui layout that collected negative energy and spirits. If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away. However, it seemed nailed to the wall and didn&rsquo;t budge no matter how he put his back into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The sight of something in the mirror shocked him out of his wits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a reflection of a youth, roughly sixteen years of age, with sculpturesque features and clear, fair skin. He looked like a perfect dandy, if not for the wan complexion that was devoid of any color. He also looked uncommonly frail, like a gust of wind would blow him away at any time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is definitely not me!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&hellip;is it an illusion?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun raised his hand, a motion mirrored by the handsome fellow in the mirror. He shook his head, once more copied by the young man in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun crashed to the floor again. &ldquo;Bloody hell, that&rsquo;s not me at all! What the freaking hell is going on??&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely flabbergasted, his mind raced furiously through his shock. He carefully recounted the events that had occurred one second prior to him falling comatose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t seem to have made it out of that certain death layout. Then I should be dead, but reborn thanks to this youth&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; He could recall the agony of despair at the moment of his death. &ldquo;Then, did that girl speak the truth? Is this a world of immortals, and the young man who I&rsquo;ve come back to life in really some kind of governor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Immortal world, world of immortals&hellip; so that means I&rsquo;m an immortal??&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed and he flung himself into the air, imitating a carp leaping out of water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crack!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He&rsquo;d thrown his back out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun laid dumbly on the floor, unable to move a finger. What the hell kind of immortal was he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, what happened to you, milord??&rdquo; Wanfeng reentered the room and quickly helped the petrified Lu Yun up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I threw my back out.&rdquo; He held his waist up. &ldquo;I, a right and proper celestial being, threw my back out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Threw your back out?&rdquo; Wanfeng blinked, her expression dimming. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, milord. If you really are a god, why would His Majesty the Celestial Emperor want to depose you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She helped Lu Yun to the bed as she spoke. Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body? The host&rsquo;s death was the reason for his second chance at life!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. This servant will still remain by your side even if you&rsquo;re not the governor. I am in the core realm and can deploy combat arts. Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage. Though there weren&rsquo;t many members, its businesses and networks stretched far. It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous. There were no lows it wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to and nothing it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lu Yun&rsquo;s grandfather and father were particularly notorious for their villainy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And perhaps because of all of the sins they&rsquo;d committed, they&rsquo;d both died during their heavenly tribulations. Lu Yun himself was cursed with a dormant bloodline that left him unable to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though he couldn&rsquo;t be a cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t fall behind his old man or grandfather at all when it came to immoral notches on his belt. In fact, he even outshone them at times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Dusk cultivators hated House Lu with a passion. But as the clan of the governor of the province, the house had plenty of experts beneath its banners. Hence, seething quietly beneath the table was all they could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, all that changed three days ago, when the Celestial Emperor of Nephrite Major issued a decree that if the new Governor of Dusk, Lu Yun, was unable to walk the path of cultivation within half a year, he would be stripped of his position. Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue? Where is he?&rdquo; Lu Yun frowned. Was there someone in the same field of work as him in the world of immortals? The layout in this room had been blatantly fatal feng shui that would kill without a single trace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had been able to come back to life in the body of another precisely because the Lu Yun of this world had died to the Nine Yin Repudiation. If he took up long term residence in this room, he would follow in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a first-class tomb raider, Lu Yun had a handle on everything from pinpointing the true location of the coffin in a tomb&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-8319\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-8319\">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;to assessing the overall feng shui of the crypt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The formation of the governor&rsquo;s manor needs maintenance, so Grand Steward Xue went out a few days ago to purchase the foundation stones for the formation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Formation?&rdquo; Lu Yun blinked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Steward Xue is a formation master. There&rsquo;s a defensive one in your room. The grand steward specially set it up because you have many enemies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. Formations of the immortal world? Feng shui layouts?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Help me up for a look.&rdquo; He took a deep breath in, still feeling a bit weak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Wanfeng reached out with a pair of fair, tender hands to help her master up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Lu Yun felt her soft, pliable body, his heart lurched.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"footnote-2b6f\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', NULL, '1666357117_banner_6352977dc58de1.jpeg', 'feng-shui-layouts', 'published', 'category', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-21 08:58:37', NULL, 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 223, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0);

Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth! Everything from time immemorial to present day is at my fingertips! I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me?

She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body? The host&rsquo;s death was the reason for his second chance at life!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. This servant will still remain by your side even if you&rsquo;re not the governor. I am in the core realm and can deploy combat arts. Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage. Though there weren&rsquo;t many members, its businesses and networks stretched far. It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous. There were no lows it wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to and nothing it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lu Yun&rsquo;s grandfather and father were particularly notorious for their villainy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And perhaps because of all of the sins they&rsquo;d committed, they&rsquo;d both died during their heavenly tribulations. Lu Yun himself was cursed with a dormant bloodline that left him unable to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though he couldn&rsquo;t be a cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t fall behind his old man or grandfather at all when it came to immoral notches on his belt. In fact, he even outshone them at times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Dusk cultivators hated House Lu with a passion. But as the clan of the governor of the province, the house had plenty of experts beneath its banners. Hence, seething quietly beneath the table was all they could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, all that changed three days ago, when the Celestial Emperor of Nephrite Major issued a decree that if the new Governor of Dusk, Lu Yun, was unable to walk the path of cultivation within half a year, he would be stripped of his position. Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue? Where is he?&rdquo; Lu Yun frowned. Was there someone in the same field of work as him in the world of immortals? The layout in this room had been blatantly fatal feng shui that would kill without a single trace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had been able to come back to life in the body of another precisely because the Lu Yun of this world had died to the Nine Yin Repudiation. If he took up long term residence in this room, he would follow in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a first-class tomb raider, Lu Yun had a handle on everything from pinpointing the true location of the coffin in a tomb&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-8319\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-8319\">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;to assessing the overall feng shui of the crypt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The formation of the governor&rsquo;s manor needs maintenance, so Grand Steward Xue went out a few days ago to purchase the foundation stones for the formation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Formation?&rdquo; Lu Yun blinked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Steward Xue is a formation master. There&rsquo;s a defensive one in your room. The grand steward specially set it up because you have many enemies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. Formations of the immortal world? Feng shui layouts?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Help me up for a look.&rdquo; He took a deep breath in, still feeling a bit weak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Wanfeng reached out with a pair of fair, tender hands to help her master up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Lu Yun felt her soft, pliable body, his heart lurched.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"footnote-2b6f\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', NULL, '1666357158_banner_635297a615f0a1.jpeg', 'formation-master.', 'published', 'category', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-21 08:59:18', NULL, 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 224, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth! Everything from time immemorial to present day is at my fingertips! I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me? The feng shui here is obviously a killing layout of Nine Yin Repudiation! Look at the bronze mirror facing the bed! Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me. Did no one get a feng shui master when they decorated the room?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As its name indicated, Nine Yin Repudiation was a feng shui layout that collected negative energy and spirits. If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away. However, it seemed nailed to the wall and didn&rsquo;t budge no matter how he put his back into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The sight of something in the mirror shocked him out of his wits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a reflection of a youth, roughly sixteen years of age, with sculpturesque features and clear, fair skin. He looked like a perfect dandy, if not for the wan complexion that was devoid of any color. He also looked uncommonly frail, like a gust of wind would blow him away at any time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is definitely not me!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&hellip;is it an illusion?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun raised his hand, a motion mirrored by the handsome fellow in the mirror. He shook his head, once more copied by the young man in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun crashed to the floor again. &ldquo;Bloody hell, that&rsquo;s not me at all! What the freaking hell is going on??&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely flabbergasted, his mind raced furiously through his shock. He carefully recounted the events that had occurred one second prior to him falling comatose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t seem to have made it out of that certain death layout. Then I should be dead, but reborn thanks to this youth&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; He could recall the agony of despair at the moment of his death. &ldquo;Then, did that girl speak the truth? Is this a world of immortals, and the young man who I&rsquo;ve come back to life in really some kind of governor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Immortal world, world of immortals&hellip; so that means I&rsquo;m an immortal??&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed and he flung himself into the air, imitating a carp leaping out of water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crack!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He&rsquo;d thrown his back out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun laid dumbly on the floor, unable to move a finger. What the hell kind of immortal was he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, what happened to you, milord??&rdquo; Wanfeng reentered the room and quickly helped the petrified Lu Yun up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I threw my back out.&rdquo; He held his waist up. &ldquo;I, a right and proper celestial being, threw my back out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Threw your back out?&rdquo; Wanfeng blinked, her expression dimming. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, milord. If you really are a god, why would His Majesty the Celestial Emperor want to depose you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She helped Lu Yun to the bed as she spoke. Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning.

I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me? The feng shui here is obviously a killing layout of Nine Yin Repudiation! Look at the bronze mirror facing the bed! Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me. Did no one get a feng shui master when they decorated the room?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As its name indicated, Nine Yin Repudiation was a feng shui layout that collected negative energy and spirits. If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away. However, it seemed nailed to the wall and didn&rsquo;t budge no matter how he put his back into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The sight of something in the mirror shocked him out of his wits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a reflection of a youth, roughly sixteen years of age, with sculpturesque features and clear, fair skin. He looked like a perfect dandy, if not for the wan complexion that was devoid of any color. He also looked uncommonly frail, like a gust of wind would blow him away at any time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is definitely not me!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&hellip;is it an illusion?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun raised his hand, a motion mirrored by the handsome fellow in the mirror. He shook his head, once more copied by the young man in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun crashed to the floor again. &ldquo;Bloody hell, that&rsquo;s not me at all! What the freaking hell is going on??&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely flabbergasted, his mind raced furiously through his shock. He carefully recounted the events that had occurred one second prior to him falling comatose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t seem to have made it out of that certain death layout. Then I should be dead, but reborn thanks to this youth&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; He could recall the agony of despair at the moment of his death. &ldquo;Then, did that girl speak the truth? Is this a world of immortals, and the young man who I&rsquo;ve come back to life in really some kind of governor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Immortal world, world of immortals&hellip; so that means I&rsquo;m an immortal??&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed and he flung himself into the air, imitating a carp leaping out of water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crack!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He&rsquo;d thrown his back out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun laid dumbly on the floor, unable to move a finger. What the hell kind of immortal was he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, what happened to you, milord??&rdquo; Wanfeng reentered the room and quickly helped the petrified Lu Yun up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I threw my back out.&rdquo; He held his waist up. &ldquo;I, a right and proper celestial being, threw my back out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Threw your back out?&rdquo; Wanfeng blinked, her expression dimming. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, milord. If you really are a god, why would His Majesty the Celestial Emperor want to depose you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She helped Lu Yun to the bed as she spoke. Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body? The host&rsquo;s death was the reason for his second chance at life!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. This servant will still remain by your side even if you&rsquo;re not the governor. I am in the core realm and can deploy combat arts. Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage. Though there weren&rsquo;t many members, its businesses and networks stretched far. It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous. There were no lows it wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to and nothing it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lu Yun&rsquo;s grandfather and father were particularly notorious for their villainy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And perhaps because of all of the sins they&rsquo;d committed, they&rsquo;d both died during their heavenly tribulations. Lu Yun himself was cursed with a dormant bloodline that left him unable to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though he couldn&rsquo;t be a cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t fall behind his old man or grandfather at all when it came to immoral notches on his belt. In fact, he even outshone them at times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Dusk cultivators hated House Lu with a passion. But as the clan of the governor of the province, the house had plenty of experts beneath its banners. Hence, seething quietly beneath the table was all they could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, all that changed three days ago, when the Celestial Emperor of Nephrite Major issued a decree that if the new Governor of Dusk, Lu Yun, was unable to walk the path of cultivation within half a year, he would be stripped of his position. Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue? Where is he?&rdquo; Lu Yun frowned. Was there someone in the same field of work as him in the world of immortals? The layout in this room had been blatantly fatal feng shui that would kill without a single trace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had been able to come back to life in the body of another precisely because the Lu Yun of this world had died to the Nine Yin Repudiation. If he took up long term residence in this room, he would follow in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a first-class tomb raider, Lu Yun had a handle on everything from pinpointing the true location of the coffin in a tomb&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-8319\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-8319\">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;to assessing the overall feng shui of the crypt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The formation of the governor&rsquo;s manor needs maintenance, so Grand Steward Xue went out a few days ago to purchase the foundation stones for the formation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Formation?&rdquo; Lu Yun blinked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Steward Xue is a formation master. There&rsquo;s a defensive one in your room. The grand steward specially set it up because you have many enemies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. Formations of the immortal world? Feng shui layouts?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Help me up for a look.&rdquo; He took a deep breath in, still feeling a bit weak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Wanfeng reached out with a pair of fair, tender hands to help her master up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Lu Yun felt her soft, pliable body, his heart lurched.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"footnote-2b6f\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', NULL, '1666357244_banner_635297fca21bf1.jpg', 'defensive-one', 'published', 'category', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-21 09:00:44', NULL, 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 228, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth!

Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body? The host&rsquo;s death was the reason for his second chance at life!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. This servant will still remain by your side even if you&rsquo;re not the governor. I am in the core realm and can deploy combat arts. Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage. Though there weren&rsquo;t many members, its businesses and networks stretched far. It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous. There were no lows it wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to and nothing it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lu Yun&rsquo;s grandfather and father were particularly notorious for their villainy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And perhaps because of all of the sins they&rsquo;d committed, they&rsquo;d both died during their heavenly tribulations. Lu Yun himself was cursed with a dormant bloodline that left him unable to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though he couldn&rsquo;t be a cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t fall behind his old man or grandfather at all when it came to immoral notches on his belt. In fact, he even outshone them at times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Dusk cultivators hated House Lu with a passion. But as the clan of the governor of the province, the house had plenty of experts beneath its banners. Hence, seething quietly beneath the table was all they could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, all that changed three days ago, when the Celestial Emperor of Nephrite Major issued a decree that if the new Governor of Dusk, Lu Yun, was unable to walk the path of cultivation within half a year, he would be stripped of his position. Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue? Where is he?&rdquo; Lu Yun frowned. Was there someone in the same field of work as him in the world of immortals? The layout in this room had been blatantly fatal feng shui that would kill without a single trace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had been able to come back to life in the body of another precisely because the Lu Yun of this world had died to the Nine Yin Repudiation. If he took up long term residence in this room, he would follow in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a first-class tomb raider, Lu Yun had a handle on everything from pinpointing the true location of the coffin in a tomb&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-8319\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-8319\">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;to assessing the overall feng shui of the crypt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The formation of the governor&rsquo;s manor needs maintenance, so Grand Steward Xue went out a few days ago to purchase the foundation stones for the formation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Formation?&rdquo; Lu Yun blinked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Steward Xue is a formation master. There&rsquo;s a defensive one in your room. The grand steward specially set it up because you have many enemies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. Formations of the immortal world? Feng shui layouts?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Help me up for a look.&rdquo; He took a deep breath in, still feeling a bit weak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Wanfeng reached out with a pair of fair, tender hands to help her master up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Lu Yun felt her soft, pliable body, his heart lurched.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"footnote-2b6f\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', NULL, '1666357284_banner_63529824e5fd21.jpeg', 'many-enemies', 'published', 'category', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-21 09:01:24', NULL, 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 229, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0);

Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth! Everything from time immemorial to present day is at my fingertips! I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me? The feng shui here is obviously a killing layout of Nine Yin Repudiation! Look at the bronze mirror facing the bed! Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me. Did no one get a feng shui master when they decorated the room?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As its name indicated, Nine Yin Repudiation was a feng shui layout that collected negative energy and spirits. If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away. However, it seemed nailed to the wall and didn&rsquo;t budge no matter how he put his back into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The sight of something in the mirror shocked him out of his wits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a reflection of a youth, roughly sixteen years of age, with sculpturesque features and clear, fair skin. He looked like a perfect dandy, if not for the wan complexion that was devoid of any color. He also looked uncommonly frail, like a gust of wind would blow him away at any time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is definitely not me!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&hellip;is it an illusion?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun raised his hand, a motion mirrored by the handsome fellow in the mirror. He shook his head, once more copied by the young man in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun crashed to the floor again. &ldquo;Bloody hell, that&rsquo;s not me at all! What the freaking hell is going on??&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely flabbergasted, his mind raced furiously through his shock. He carefully recounted the events that had occurred one second prior to him falling comatose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t seem to have made it out of that certain death layout. Then I should be dead, but reborn thanks to this youth&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; He could recall the agony of despair at the moment of his death. &ldquo;Then, did that girl speak the truth? Is this a world of immortals, and the young man who I&rsquo;ve come back to life in really some kind of governor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Immortal world, world of immortals&hellip; so that means I&rsquo;m an immortal??&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed and he flung himself into the air, imitating a carp leaping out of water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crack!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He&rsquo;d thrown his back out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun laid dumbly on the floor, unable to move a finger. What the hell kind of immortal was he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, what happened to you, milord??&rdquo; Wanfeng reentered the room and quickly helped the petrified Lu Yun up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I threw my back out.&rdquo; He held his waist up. &ldquo;I, a right and proper celestial being, threw my back out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Threw your back out?&rdquo; Wanfeng blinked, her expression dimming. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, milord. If you really are a god, why would His Majesty the Celestial Emperor want to depose you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She helped Lu Yun to the bed as she spoke. Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning.

Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth! Everything from time immemorial to present day is at my fingertips! I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me? The feng shui here is obviously a killing layout of Nine Yin Repudiation! Look at the bronze mirror facing the bed! Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me. Did no one get a feng shui master when they decorated the room?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As its name indicated, Nine Yin Repudiation was a feng shui layout that collected negative energy and spirits. If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away. However, it seemed nailed to the wall and didn&rsquo;t budge no matter how he put his back into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The sight of something in the mirror shocked him out of his wits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a reflection of a youth, roughly sixteen years of age, with sculpturesque features and clear, fair skin. He looked like a perfect dandy, if not for the wan complexion that was devoid of any color. He also looked uncommonly frail, like a gust of wind would blow him away at any time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is definitely not me!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&hellip;is it an illusion?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun raised his hand, a motion mirrored by the handsome fellow in the mirror. He shook his head, once more copied by the young man in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun crashed to the floor again. &ldquo;Bloody hell, that&rsquo;s not me at all! What the freaking hell is going on??&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely flabbergasted, his mind raced furiously through his shock. He carefully recounted the events that had occurred one second prior to him falling comatose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t seem to have made it out of that certain death layout. Then I should be dead, but reborn thanks to this youth&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; He could recall the agony of despair at the moment of his death. &ldquo;Then, did that girl speak the truth? Is this a world of immortals, and the young man who I&rsquo;ve come back to life in really some kind of governor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Immortal world, world of immortals&hellip; so that means I&rsquo;m an immortal??&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed and he flung himself into the air, imitating a carp leaping out of water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crack!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He&rsquo;d thrown his back out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun laid dumbly on the floor, unable to move a finger. What the hell kind of immortal was he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, what happened to you, milord??&rdquo; Wanfeng reentered the room and quickly helped the petrified Lu Yun up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I threw my back out.&rdquo; He held his waist up. &ldquo;I, a right and proper celestial being, threw my back out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Threw your back out?&rdquo; Wanfeng blinked, her expression dimming. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, milord. If you really are a god, why would His Majesty the Celestial Emperor want to depose you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She helped Lu Yun to the bed as she spoke. Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body? The host&rsquo;s death was the reason for his second chance at life!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. This servant will still remain by your side even if you&rsquo;re not the governor. I am in the core realm and can deploy combat arts. Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage. Though there weren&rsquo;t many members, its businesses and networks stretched far. It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous. There were no lows it wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to and nothing it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lu Yun&rsquo;s grandfather and father were particularly notorious for their villainy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And perhaps because of all of the sins they&rsquo;d committed, they&rsquo;d both died during their heavenly tribulations. Lu Yun himself was cursed with a dormant bloodline that left him unable to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though he couldn&rsquo;t be a cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t fall behind his old man or grandfather at all when it came to immoral notches on his belt. In fact, he even outshone them at times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Dusk cultivators hated House Lu with a passion. But as the clan of the governor of the province, the house had plenty of experts beneath its banners. Hence, seething quietly beneath the table was all they could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, all that changed three days ago, when the Celestial Emperor of Nephrite Major issued a decree that if the new Governor of Dusk, Lu Yun, was unable to walk the path of cultivation within half a year, he would be stripped of his position. Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue? Where is he?&rdquo; Lu Yun frowned. Was there someone in the same field of work as him in the world of immortals? The layout in this room had been blatantly fatal feng shui that would kill without a single trace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had been able to come back to life in the body of another precisely because the Lu Yun of this world had died to the Nine Yin Repudiation. If he took up long term residence in this room, he would follow in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a first-class tomb raider, Lu Yun had a handle on everything from pinpointing the true location of the coffin in a tomb&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-8319\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-8319\">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;to assessing the overall feng shui of the crypt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The formation of the governor&rsquo;s manor needs maintenance, so Grand Steward Xue went out a few days ago to purchase the foundation stones for the formation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Formation?&rdquo; Lu Yun blinked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Steward Xue is a formation master. There&rsquo;s a defensive one in your room. The grand steward specially set it up because you have many enemies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. Formations of the immortal world? Feng shui layouts?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Help me up for a look.&rdquo; He took a deep breath in, still feeling a bit weak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Wanfeng reached out with a pair of fair, tender hands to help her master up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Lu Yun felt her soft, pliable body, his heart lurched.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"footnote-2b6f\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', NULL, '1666357441_banner_635298c1eb19b1.jpg', 'formations-of-the-immortal-world', 'published', 'category', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-21 09:04:01', NULL, 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 226, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0);

Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away. However, it seemed nailed to the wall and didn&rsquo;t budge no matter how he put his back into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The sight of something in the mirror shocked him out of his wits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a reflection of a youth, roughly sixteen years of age, with sculpturesque features and clear, fair skin. He looked like a perfect dandy, if not for the wan complexion that was devoid of any color. He also looked uncommonly frail, like a gust of wind would blow him away at any time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is definitely not me!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&hellip;is it an illusion?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun raised his hand, a motion mirrored by the handsome fellow in the mirror. He shook his head, once more copied by the young man in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun crashed to the floor again. &ldquo;Bloody hell, that&rsquo;s not me at all! What the freaking hell is going on??&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely flabbergasted, his mind raced furiously through his shock. He carefully recounted the events that had occurred one second prior to him falling comatose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t seem to have made it out of that certain death layout. Then I should be dead, but reborn thanks to this youth&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; He could recall the agony of despair at the moment of his death. &ldquo;Then, did that girl speak the truth? Is this a world of immortals, and the young man who I&rsquo;ve come back to life in really some kind of governor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Immortal world, world of immortals&hellip; so that means I&rsquo;m an immortal??&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed and he flung himself into the air, imitating a carp leaping out of water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crack!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He&rsquo;d thrown his back out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun laid dumbly on the floor, unable to move a finger. What the hell kind of immortal was he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, what happened to you, milord??&rdquo; Wanfeng reentered the room and quickly helped the petrified Lu Yun up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I threw my back out.&rdquo; He held his waist up. &ldquo;I, a right and proper celestial being, threw my back out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Threw your back out?&rdquo; Wanfeng blinked, her expression dimming. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, milord. If you really are a god, why would His Majesty the Celestial Emperor want to depose you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She helped Lu Yun to the bed as she spoke. Afterward, a small dot of green splendor appeared at her fingertip. She gently stroked Lu Yun&rsquo;s waist, sending a cool current into it and dissolving that ridiculously painful ache.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She&rsquo;s a fairy, this unbearably beautiful chick is totally a fairy!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Am I not an immortal?&rdquo; Lu Yun sat up again in his hurry to seek answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not even a cultivator, much less an immortal.&rdquo; Wanfeng sighed with resignation. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a cultivator, His Majesty decreed that if you still can&rsquo;t walk the immortal dao after six months, you will be removed from the position of governor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Cultivator?&rdquo; It was Lu Yun&rsquo;s turn to pause, but didn&rsquo;t continue his line of questioning. He was no fool. Continuing that particular train of thought would very possibly mean exposing himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little beauty in front of him named Wanfeng may be delightfully charming and look very biddable, but who knew what would happen if she learned that he was a foreign soul in her master&rsquo;s body? The host&rsquo;s death was the reason for his second chance at life!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. This servant will still remain by your side even if you&rsquo;re not the governor. I am in the core realm and can deploy combat arts. Even if I can&rsquo;t fight off those people, there&rsquo;s no problem in making an escape with you.&rdquo; Wanfeng brimmed with confidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It looks like I have quite a few enemies.&rdquo; Lu Yun laughed wryly. The maid fell silent as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the previous owner of this body was also named Lu Yun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">House Lu of Dusk Province was of a long and illustrious lineage. Though there weren&rsquo;t many members, its businesses and networks stretched far. It was the greatest cultivation clan in the province and held power over the seat of governor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this aristocratic house was incredibly infamous. There were no lows it wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to and nothing it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lu Yun&rsquo;s grandfather and father were particularly notorious for their villainy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And perhaps because of all of the sins they&rsquo;d committed, they&rsquo;d both died during their heavenly tribulations. Lu Yun himself was cursed with a dormant bloodline that left him unable to cultivate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though he couldn&rsquo;t be a cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t fall behind his old man or grandfather at all when it came to immoral notches on his belt. In fact, he even outshone them at times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Dusk cultivators hated House Lu with a passion. But as the clan of the governor of the province, the house had plenty of experts beneath its banners. Hence, seething quietly beneath the table was all they could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, all that changed three days ago, when the Celestial Emperor of Nephrite Major issued a decree that if the new Governor of Dusk, Lu Yun, was unable to walk the path of cultivation within half a year, he would be stripped of his position. Another clan would be chosen in the Lus&rsquo; stead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In poor health to begin with, the former governor, a Lu descendant, immediately keeled over in a dead faint and departed the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultivators who normally swore undying fealty to House Lu instantly vanished without a trace. Just as monkeys scattered when a tree fell, so did hangers-on ditch the power they clung to when it fell out of favor. There were still a few left in the governor&rsquo;s manor, but they were all waiting for the new governor to arrive in half a year&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng thought that Lu Yun&rsquo;s mind was unclear from the shock he&rsquo;d suffered, thus she recounted his current circumstances so that he&rsquo;d be prepared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wanfeng, that mirror really annoys me. Move it away for me.&rdquo; Lu Yun pointed at the mirror facing the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Wanfeng waved a hand at the unmovable mirror and sent it casually flying out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That potted plant over there. Throw it out too!&rdquo; Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Was Wanfeng a divine fairy, or really just a cultivator?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He didn&rsquo;t notice that Wanfeng had used the words &ldquo;walk the immortal dao&rdquo; just now, instead of the term &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The maid didn&rsquo;t understand the orders, but followed them nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second the plant flew out, Lu Yun felt a bout of stifling air that&rsquo;d been pressing down on him suddenly dissipate. Everything felt much more comfortable and smooth. Nine Yin Repudiation was fatal to ordinary mortals, but absolutely nothing to a cultivator in the core realm like Wanfeng.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ah yes, Wanfeng, who decorated this room?&rdquo; Lu Yun asked after a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue did.&rdquo; Wanfeng also felt that something seemed to have changed in the room, but couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Grand Steward Xue? Where is he?&rdquo; Lu Yun frowned. Was there someone in the same field of work as him in the world of immortals? The layout in this room had been blatantly fatal feng shui that would kill without a single trace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had been able to come back to life in the body of another precisely because the Lu Yun of this world had died to the Nine Yin Repudiation. If he took up long term residence in this room, he would follow in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a first-class tomb raider, Lu Yun had a handle on everything from pinpointing the true location of the coffin in a tomb&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-8319\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-8319\">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;to assessing the overall feng shui of the crypt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The formation of the governor&rsquo;s manor needs maintenance, so Grand Steward Xue went out a few days ago to purchase the foundation stones for the formation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Formation?&rdquo; Lu Yun blinked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Steward Xue is a formation master. There&rsquo;s a defensive one in your room. The grand steward specially set it up because you have many enemies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. Formations of the immortal world? Feng shui layouts?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Help me up for a look.&rdquo; He took a deep breath in, still feeling a bit weak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Wanfeng reached out with a pair of fair, tender hands to help her master up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Lu Yun felt her soft, pliable body, his heart lurched.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"footnote-2b6f\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', NULL, '1666357472_banner_635298e09f59c1.jpeg', 'steward-xue1', 'published', 'category', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-21 09:04:32', NULL, 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 225, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Shit that&rsquo;s f*cking embarrassing! A lifelong goose hunter had his eyes pecked out by a goose instead! Why the hell was there a layout of certain death in a Han Dynasty civilian tomb?? What kind of idiotic, hairy-nosed hateful asshole set up something so foul?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Eh? Wait&hellip; I&rsquo;m not dead?&rdquo; Frozen, Lu Yun blinked and quickly patted himself down. &ldquo;Hahahahaha! Not dead! Damn straight! I, Lu Yun, grasp everything beneath the heavens and earth! Everything from time immemorial to present day is at my fingertips! I&rsquo;m the strongest, the best commandant of tomb raiders there&rsquo;s ever been!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So how would I possibly die in an ordinary tomb? If it wasn&rsquo;t for that certain death layout appearing so suddenly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been trapped either!&rdquo; he continued to cackle. All was fine as long as he wasn&rsquo;t dead! Thank goodness he hadn&rsquo;t lost face for the grandmaster, the founder of tomb raider lineage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;But, what a pity I didn&rsquo;t bring that ancient bronze tome out with me. It looked quite valuable.&rdquo; Lu Yun smacked his lips. &ldquo;Wait a sec, where am I?&rdquo; He jerked his head up, scanning his surroundings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It appeared to be a room of ancient flair. Opulent decorations elegantly graced the classically arranged premises. Luminous pearls glowed with soft radiance in the four corners of the room, illuminating the entire space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the panorama sent shudders down Lu Yun&rsquo;s spine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Does the owner of this room want to die, or is he trying to cast a death curse on me? The feng shui here is obviously a killing layout of Nine Yin Repudiation! Look at the bronze mirror facing the bed! Isn&rsquo;t he afraid of breeding ghosts with this setup??</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell kind of place is this? The owner saved me, so he shouldn&rsquo;t want to kill me. Did no one get a feng shui master when they decorated the room?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As its name indicated, Nine Yin Repudiation was a feng shui layout that collected negative energy and spirits. If people dwelled within this arrangement for too long, sickness and poor health would visit them, and their lifespans would greatly shorten.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The door to the room opened while a stunned Lu Yun remained lost in thought. Dressed in a green skirt, a young girl walked in holding a tray of food.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She looked rather young, sixteen years old at most. Waist-length hair flowed down her back and over her shoulders, framing her bright eyes and pearly-white teeth. She was an uncommonly good-looking little beauty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun had weathered more than a few years of life and seen his share of beauties, but his heart still skipped a beat when he saw this one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A period costume? Are they filming something here? Is she a child actress? No wonder she&rsquo;s so pretty. What film set have I crashed?&nbsp;He panned around again, but found no cameras or crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord governor&nbsp;<span id=\"footnote-ref-7b84\"><a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/necropolis-immortal/necro-chapter-1#footnote-7b84\">[1]</a></span>, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; The girl picked up a bowl sculpted from white jade and approached Lu Yun. A wonderful fragrance burrowed into his nose. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was from the girl or the soup that sparkled with pale-purple luminance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sparkling soup? Is that even edible?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Lu Yun scooted backward. &ldquo;What did you call me? Milord governor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing made sense to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a grave robber well versed in Chinese history, he knew precisely what she meant with the title she&rsquo;d used for governor. In modern terms, it meant shepherd, indicating that the office-holder was to guide and care for his people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ancient history saw Chinese territory delineated as nine provinces, and the governor the highest ranking official of the province. Such a position had been created in the Han Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is this a Han Dynasty film crew? Is this young beauty too caught up in her character and hasn&rsquo;t snapped out of it yet?&nbsp;Lu Yun rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong person. I&rsquo;m not one of your actors, so you don&rsquo;t need to practice your lines with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Milord, have you suffered from too much shock and lost your mind? This servant is your maid, Wanfeng.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes reddened. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord, I will follow you even when you&rsquo;re not the governor. I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lu Yun didn&rsquo;t know what to do with such a reaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; He turned around, looking for some normal people to talk to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Dusk City.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dusk City?&rdquo; There didn&rsquo;t seem to be such a place in China.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dusk City is in Dusk Province, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Dusk Province?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In Nephrite Major.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s Nephrite Major?&rdquo; Lu Yun was completely lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Nephrite Major is part of the nine majors, ten lands, and four seas of the immortal world, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thump!&nbsp;Lu Yun&rsquo;s eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed back onto the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crazy, completely crazy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such a charmingly pretty little girl was a complete lunatic!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanfeng&rsquo;s mouth twisted and she almost burst into tears. The lord had finally awoken, but he&rsquo;d fainted dead away again! She placed the bowl of sparkling soup onto the bedside table and quietly backed out of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After an unknown period of time, Lu Yun awoke again. &ldquo;Did that crazy girl leave yet?&rdquo; Rubbing his forehead, he glimpsed the bowl of purple soup next to his bed. &ldquo;Mm, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a bit hungry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he picked up the bowl of strange soup and gulped it down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Phew, it&rsquo;s not poisoned.&rdquo; A burp and a sigh later, a warm current circulated throughout his body. Some strength gradually returned to his limp, listless form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This film crew&rsquo;s some kinda rich, huh! This bowl&rsquo;s gotta be worth a few million, but they&rsquo;re using it as a prop! Nuts.&rdquo; Out of professional habit, Lu Yun tucked the bowl away into his clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;They even put me in an ancient costume and shoved a wig on me! Is it because they saw what a gorgeous, handsome, dashing ladies&rsquo; man I am that they decided I should be the male lead?&rdquo; He clambered down from the bed and struck a leisurely pose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;First things first, we&rsquo;ve got to break the layout of Nine Yin Repudiation in this room.&rdquo; He walked over to the mirror and placed both hands on it, wanting to shift it away.

But the farms had water in them, and as the oxen traveled, the muddy water splashed. Whether it was the oxen or the farmers, they were all covered in mud.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One farmer appeared to be in his thirties. Through the layers of mud, it was vaguely possible to see he was a suntanned man busy with his honest labor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He was constantly shouting, directing the oxen. Only once the land was level could he begin planting the seedlings. This entire year&rsquo;s crop depended on the spring, so he couldn&rsquo;t waste this sunlight.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Suddenly, a tender shout rang out. The man turned to see a little girl who appeared to be between three or four years old running over to him on the embankment between farms. She held two wild fruits in her hand as she excitedly shouted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little girl wore her hair in pigtails, and she wore a cotton jacket. Although it was spring, this early spring morning was still a bit chilly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She was a beautiful girl who seemed like an adorable doll, with her jade-like face and her crescent eyebrows. Her eyes were the perfect proportion of white and black.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Little Yan, why have you run over here? Look, you dirtied your jacket. Aren&rsquo;t you afraid your mom will spank you?&rdquo; The suntanned man immediately smiled, looking at the little girl with love. Even his tiredness was swept away by her arrival.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Mom won&rsquo;t hit me. I came here to bring dad some fruit! Aiya!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Careful!&rdquo; the suntanned man cried out. The embankment was very muddy, and the girl slipped and fell. Those two fruits she was carrying fell into the mud, and even her dress was dirtied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She immediately began to bawl. The man hastily ran over and wiped her dress a few times. Picking her up, he placed her on a larger rock to the side of the embankment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Little Yan, what hurts? Tell dad,&rdquo; he said, worriedly looking at her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry dad, Little Yan is too stupid. I got the fruit dirty&hellip;&rdquo; Little Yan cried, obviously feeling both embarrassed and angry from having her good deed ruined.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hearing that, the man immediately relaxed and smiled. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s so dirty about them?&rdquo; The man directly dug the two fruits from the mud, wiped them a few times, and then took a big bite.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dad, they&rsquo;re dirty! Mom said that if you eat dirty things, they&rsquo;ll grow insects inside your stomach! I&rsquo;ll go wash them in the river!&rdquo; cried the girl.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Haha, that&rsquo;s something that will only happen to children. Your dad&rsquo;s stomach is strong and he can eat them without worry!&rdquo; The man patted his chest confidently.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Really? Dad is amazing!&rdquo; The girl actually believed him and looked at him worshipfully.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Come, give dad a hug. Dad will bring you home and have your mom change your clothes. If you&rsquo;re so dirty, you won&rsquo;t look like a little fairy.&rdquo; The man took off his outer clothes and lifted the girl. He was afraid of getting the girl&rsquo;s clothes dirty. He clearly doted on her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dad, am I holding up your work?&rdquo; she asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Of course not. I&rsquo;ve already worked for a while and I needed a break. Let alone your dad, even the oxen need a rest,&rdquo; comforted the man.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dad really is the best!&rdquo; The girl leaned over to kiss him on the cheek.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. Your dad is dirty, so you can&rsquo;t kiss him. If you eat any dirt, bugs will grow in your stomach!&rdquo; The man hastily dodged with a laugh.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll wait until dad is clean!&rdquo; The girl hung onto his neck.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Carrying the girl, the man crossed the farmland and arrived on the path to return to the village.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Hey, Leng Erhei, this girl of yours has such pale skin. It&rsquo;s a completely different color from yours. It couldn&rsquo;t be that your wife wasn&rsquo;t loyal to you, right?&rdquo; joked a fellow farmer who was busy in the fields when he saw them passing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These farmers all liked to joke around, and in truth, they were very close to each other. This joke didn&rsquo;t harbor any ill intent. They were all used to it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Screw off. You and your wife are both so pale, but your child looks like he is made of mud. I heard that he fell once, and it was impossible to tell him apart from the ground. It was only the next day that you found him. You&rsquo;re clearly just jealous,&rdquo; laughed the man who had been called Leng Erhei.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Hehe, my second son is two years older than your girl. Those ages just happen to be suitable. What do you think about setting them up?&rdquo; That farmer&rsquo;s eyebrows rolled several times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about it. This girl of mine is like a heavenly fairy. But your son really is not bad. He&rsquo;ll definitely be a capable hunter in the future.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be invisible once he&rsquo;s tossed to the ground, and even prey won&rsquo;t notice him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Hahaha.&rdquo; Leng Erhei laughed and left, bringing his daughter into the village.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The village wasn&rsquo;t very large. There were only a few dozen households. They lived off the land, relying entirely on farming, hunting, and gathering.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once the two of them arrived, a few women looking after children immediately smiled toward them, praising the girl for being smart and attractive. Although they often saw her, it always felt like it wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The girl was also very adorable, cutely calling them third aunt, second aunt, and so on. These villagers lived simple and honest lives here, and they all got along with each other.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, my little girl, what happened to you? Are you alright?&rdquo; A woman immediately walked over upon seeing them. Seeing her current appearance, she was both angered and distressed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine. She just fell down and got her clothes dirty. Why don&rsquo;t you go ask mom to change your clothes? I&rsquo;ll get back to work.&rdquo; Leng Erhei rubbed the girl&rsquo;s head and then left.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The girl&rsquo;s mother brought out a set of clean clothes for Little Yan. She had just helped her change into them when the sound of rapid hoofbeats rang out along with several startled cries.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What are you doing?!&rdquo; Leng Erhei was amongst them. But after a muffled groan, his voice was cut off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Little Yan, don&rsquo;t move. Mom will go out to take a look.&rdquo; Little Yan&rsquo;s mother hastily ran out of the courtyard to see over ten black-robed men.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each of them was large and stocky, and they were currently shouting something. Little Yan&rsquo;s mother quickly saw Leng Erhei on the ground.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Erhei!&rdquo; cried Little Yan&rsquo;s mother. She ran over to his side and saw that his nose was sunken in. His teeth had been knocked out of his mouth and his face was covered with blood.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The entire village was panicked. They had never seen such strong people. The villagers quickly grabbed their children and stared fearfully at the black-robed men.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of those black-robed men carried swords on their backs, some carried sabers on their waists. They seemed like evil fiends to these villagers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following the panic in the village, the men working on the farms all rushed back. Seeing Leng Erhei lying on the ground, they shouted furiously, &ldquo;What are you doing!?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pfft! One man had just opened his mouth when one of those black-robed men with a scar on his face unsheathed his saber and cut off that man&rsquo;s head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;AH! They&rsquo;re killers! Run!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">PFFT! One of the shouting women was directly cut in two by another man. The villagers were all scared stupid. The sound of crying and terrified shouts echoed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;How vexing. We were actually sent to this region. How are we supposed to find any good seedlings amongst these peasants?&rdquo; One of the black-robed men spat on the ground as his gaze swept across the quivering villagers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">His gaze was focused on the children the women were carrying. A cold light shone in his eyes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What a waste of time. Kill them all. Such inferior people aren&rsquo;t fit to live in this world. They should make room for useful people,&rdquo; said the scar-faced man who seemed to be the leader. As he spoke, he randomly slashed his saber. One man was directly killed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you!&rdquo; One village man attacked one of the black-robed men with a farming pick.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But he had only just raised it when a sword pierced his chest. That man looked at the sword piercing his chest and unwillingly collapsed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; A seven-year-old boy ran over, wailing. With a single kick from the black-robed man, that child was sent flying.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the black-robed men arrived in front of Leng Erhei. At this time, Leng Erhei had just been woken by his wife. Seeing the black-robed men, he immediately pushed his wife behind him and shouted, &ldquo;If you have any guts, then come at us! Leave the women alone!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The weak don&rsquo;t have the qualifications to set conditions!&rdquo; The black-robed man kicked Leng Erhei in the chest, and he and his wife were both sent tumbling back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The black-robed man raised his sword again. It began to fall toward Leng Erhei&rsquo;s neck without the slightest mercy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt daddy!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At some unknown point, the little girl had also run over. She stood in front of Leng Erhei&rsquo;s body. She stared at the black-robed man with her black and white eyes. A courageous light shone in those eyes, a light without the slightest fear.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Seeing Little Yan run over, Leng Erhei was startled and hastily pulled her back, giving her to his wife. &ldquo;Bring Little Yan away!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Little Yan&rsquo;s mother picked her up and immediately fled for her life. The black-robed man was about to chase when Leng Erhei grabbed his waist and swept out his leg. In his carelessness, the black-robed man actually tripped to the ground.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Die!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With a furious roar, that black-robed man smashed a fist at Leng Erhei&rsquo;s back.</p>', NULL, '1666959310_banner_635bc7ce56e3a1.jpg', 'seeing-little', 'published', 'category', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-28 08:15:10', NULL, 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 259, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

He&rsquo;ll definitely be a capable hunter in the future.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be invisible once he&rsquo;s tossed to the ground, and even prey won&rsquo;t notice him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Hahaha.&rdquo; Leng Erhei laughed and left, bringing his daughter into the village.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The village wasn&rsquo;t very large. There were only a few dozen households. They lived off the land, relying entirely on farming, hunting, and gathering.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once the two of them arrived, a few women looking after children immediately smiled toward them, praising the girl for being smart and attractive. Although they often saw her, it always felt like it wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The girl was also very adorable, cutely calling them third aunt, second aunt, and so on. These villagers lived simple and honest lives here, and they all got along with each other.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, my little girl, what happened to you? Are you alright?&rdquo; A woman immediately walked over upon seeing them. Seeing her current appearance, she was both angered and distressed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine. She just fell down and got her clothes dirty. Why don&rsquo;t you go ask mom to change your clothes? I&rsquo;ll get back to work.&rdquo; Leng Erhei rubbed the girl&rsquo;s head and then left.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The girl&rsquo;s mother brought out a set of clean clothes for Little Yan. She had just helped her change into them when the sound of rapid hoofbeats rang out along with several startled cries.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What are you doing?!&rdquo; Leng Erhei was amongst them. But after a muffled groan, his voice was cut off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Little Yan, don&rsquo;t move. Mom will go out to take a look.&rdquo; Little Yan&rsquo;s mother hastily ran out of the courtyard to see over ten black-robed men.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each of them was large and stocky, and they were currently shouting something. Little Yan&rsquo;s mother quickly saw Leng Erhei on the ground.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Erhei!&rdquo; cried Little Yan&rsquo;s mother. She ran over to his side and saw that his nose was sunken in. His teeth had been knocked out of his mouth and his face was covered with blood.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The entire village was panicked. They had never seen such strong people. The villagers quickly grabbed their children and stared fearfully at the black-robed men.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of those black-robed men carried swords on their backs, some carried sabers on their waists. They seemed like evil fiends to these villagers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following the panic in the village, the men working on the farms all rushed back. Seeing Leng Erhei lying on the ground, they shouted furiously, &ldquo;What are you doing!?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pfft! One man had just opened his mouth when one of those black-robed men with a scar on his face unsheathed his saber and cut off that man&rsquo;s head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;AH! They&rsquo;re killers! Run!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">PFFT! One of the shouting women was directly cut in two by another man. The villagers were all scared stupid. The sound of crying and terrified shouts echoed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;How vexing. We were actually sent to this region. How are we supposed to find any good seedlings amongst these peasants?&rdquo; One of the black-robed men spat on the ground as his gaze swept across the quivering villagers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">His gaze was focused on the children the women were carrying. A cold light shone in his eyes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What a waste of time. Kill them all. Such inferior people aren&rsquo;t fit to live in this world. They should make room for useful people,&rdquo; said the scar-faced man who seemed to be the leader. As he spoke, he randomly slashed his saber. One man was directly killed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you!&rdquo; One village man attacked one of the black-robed men with a farming pick.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But he had only just raised it when a sword pierced his chest. That man looked at the sword piercing his chest and unwillingly collapsed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; A seven-year-old boy ran over, wailing. With a single kick from the black-robed man, that child was sent flying.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the black-robed men arrived in front of Leng Erhei. At this time, Leng Erhei had just been woken by his wife. Seeing the black-robed men, he immediately pushed his wife behind him and shouted, &ldquo;If you have any guts, then come at us! Leave the women alone!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The weak don&rsquo;t have the qualifications to set conditions!&rdquo; The black-robed man kicked Leng Erhei in the chest, and he and his wife were both sent tumbling back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The black-robed man raised his sword again. It began to fall toward Leng Erhei&rsquo;s neck without the slightest mercy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt daddy!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At some unknown point, the little girl had also run over. She stood in front of Leng Erhei&rsquo;s body. She stared at the black-robed man with her black and white eyes. A courageous light shone in those eyes, a light without the slightest fear.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Seeing Little Yan run over, Leng Erhei was startled and hastily pulled her back, giving her to his wife. &ldquo;Bring Little Yan away!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Little Yan&rsquo;s mother picked her up and immediately fled for her life. The black-robed man was about to chase when Leng Erhei grabbed his waist and swept out his leg. In his carelessness, the black-robed man actually tripped to the ground.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Die!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With a furious roar, that black-robed man smashed a fist at Leng Erhei&rsquo;s back.</p>', NULL, '1666959338_banner_635bc7eab16061.jpg', 'bring-little-yan-away', 'published', 'category', 1, NULL, 'general', '2022-10-28 08:15:38', NULL, 'author', 0, NULL, 1, 'chapter', 'aed', 500, 0, NULL, 259, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Farmland lined the river, and with the sun&rsquo;s warm rays already lighting up the land, the farmers had long since gotten to work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The oxen were walking back and forth on the farms, pulling on the plows that broke apart the earth. But the farms had water in them, and as the oxen traveled, the muddy water splashed. Whether it was the oxen or the farmers, they were all covered in mud.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One farmer appeared to be in his thirties. Through the layers of mud, it was vaguely possible to see he was a suntanned man busy with his honest labor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He was constantly shouting, directing the oxen. Only once the land was level could he begin planting the seedlings. This entire year&rsquo;s crop depended on the spring, so he couldn&rsquo;t waste this sunlight.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Suddenly, a tender shout rang out. The man turned to see a little girl who appeared to be between three or four years old running over to him on the embankment between farms. She held two wild fruits in her hand as she excitedly shouted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little girl wore her hair in pigtails, and she wore a cotton jacket. Although it was spring, this early spring morning was still a bit chilly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She was a beautiful girl who seemed like an adorable doll, with her jade-like face and her crescent eyebrows. Her eyes were the perfect proportion of white and black.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Little Yan, why have you run over here? Look, you dirtied your jacket. Aren&rsquo;t you afraid your mom will spank you?&rdquo; The suntanned man immediately smiled, looking at the little girl with love. Even his tiredness was swept away by her arrival.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Mom won&rsquo;t hit me. I came here to bring dad some fruit! Aiya!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Careful!&rdquo; the suntanned man cried out. The embankment was very muddy, and the girl slipped and fell. Those two fruits she was carrying fell into the mud, and even her dress was dirtied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She immediately began to bawl. The man hastily ran over and wiped her dress a few times. Picking her up, he placed her on a larger rock to the side of the embankment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Little Yan, what hurts? Tell dad,&rdquo; he said, worriedly looking at her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry dad, Little Yan is too stupid. I got the fruit dirty&hellip;&rdquo; Little Yan cried, obviously feeling both embarrassed and angry from having her good deed ruined.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hearing that, the man immediately relaxed and smiled. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s so dirty about them?&rdquo; The man directly dug the two fruits from the mud, wiped them a few times, and then took a big bite.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dad, they&rsquo;re dirty! Mom said that if you eat dirty things, they&rsquo;ll grow insects inside your stomach! I&rsquo;ll go wash them in the river!&rdquo; cried the girl.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Haha, that&rsquo;s something that will only happen to children. Your dad&rsquo;s stomach is strong and he can eat them without worry!&rdquo; The man patted his chest confidently.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Really? Dad is amazing!&rdquo; The girl actually believed him and looked at him worshipfully.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Come, give dad a hug. Dad will bring you home and have your mom change your clothes. If you&rsquo;re so dirty, you won&rsquo;t look like a little fairy.&rdquo; The man took off his outer clothes and lifted the girl. He was afraid of getting the girl&rsquo;s clothes dirty. He clearly doted on her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dad, am I holding up your work?&rdquo; she asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Of course not. I&rsquo;ve already worked for a while and I needed a break. Let alone your dad, even the oxen need a rest,&rdquo; comforted the man.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dad really is the best!&rdquo; The girl leaned over to kiss him on the cheek.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. Your dad is dirty, so you can&rsquo;t kiss him. If you eat any dirt, bugs will grow in your stomach!&rdquo; The man hastily dodged with a laugh.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll wait until dad is clean!&rdquo; The girl hung onto his neck.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Carrying the girl, the man crossed the farmland and arrived on the path to return to the village.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Hey, Leng Erhei, this girl of yours has such pale skin. It&rsquo;s a completely different color from yours. It couldn&rsquo;t be that your wife wasn&rsquo;t loyal to you, right?&rdquo; joked a fellow farmer who was busy in the fields when he saw them passing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These farmers all liked to joke around, and in truth, they were very close to each other. This joke didn&rsquo;t harbor any ill intent. They were all used to it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Screw off. You and your wife are both so pale, but your child looks like he is made of mud. I heard that he fell once, and it was impossible to tell him apart from the ground. It was only the next day that you found him. You&rsquo;re clearly just jealous,&rdquo; laughed the man who had been called Leng Erhei.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Hehe, my second son is two years older than your girl. Those ages just happen to be suitable. What do you think about setting them up?&rdquo; That farmer&rsquo;s eyebrows rolled several times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about it.

She ran over to his side and saw that his nose was sunken in. His teeth had been knocked out of his mouth and his face was covered with blood.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The entire village was panicked. They had never seen such strong people. The villagers quickly grabbed their children and stared fearfully at the black-robed men.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of those black-robed men carried swords on their backs, some carried sabers on their waists. They seemed like evil fiends to these villagers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following the panic in the village, the men working on the farms all rushed back. Seeing Leng Erhei lying on the ground, they shouted furiously, &ldquo;What are you doing!?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pfft! One man had just opened his mouth when one of those black-robed men with a scar on his face unsheathed his saber and cut off that man&rsquo;s head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;AH!

With a single kick from the black-robed man, that child was sent flying.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the black-robed men arrived in front of Leng Erhei. At this time, Leng Erhei had just been woken by his wife. Seeing the black-robed men, he immediately pushed his wife behind him and shouted, &ldquo;If you have any guts, then come at us! Leave the women alone!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The weak don&rsquo;t have the qualifications to set conditions!&rdquo; The black-robed man kicked Leng Erhei in the chest, and he and his wife were both sent tumbling back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The black-robed man raised his sword again. It began to fall toward Leng Erhei&rsquo;s neck without the slightest mercy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt daddy!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At some unknown point, the little girl had also run over. She stood in front of Leng Erhei&rsquo;s body. She stared at the black-robed man with her black and white eyes. A courageous light shone in those eyes, a light without the slightest fear.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Seeing Little Yan run over, Leng Erhei was startled and hastily pulled her back, giving her to his wife. &ldquo;Bring Little Yan away!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Little Yan&rsquo;s mother picked her up and immediately fled for her life.

(266, 'Seeing Little-12', NULL, NULL, '<p dir=\"ltr\">A small river flowed within the surrounding mountains. Farmland lined the river, and with the sun&rsquo;s warm rays already lighting up the land, the farmers had long since gotten to work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The oxen were walking back and forth on the farms, pulling on the plows that broke apart the earth. But the farms had water in them, and as the oxen traveled, the muddy water splashed. Whether it was the oxen or the farmers, they were all covered in mud.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One farmer appeared to be in his thirties. Through the layers of mud, it was vaguely possible to see he was a suntanned man busy with his honest labor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He was constantly shouting, directing the oxen. Only once the land was level could he begin planting the seedlings. This entire year&rsquo;s crop depended on the spring, so he couldn&rsquo;t waste this sunlight.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Suddenly, a tender shout rang out. The man turned to see a little girl who appeared to be between three or four years old running over to him on the embankment between farms. She held two wild fruits in her hand as she excitedly shouted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The little girl wore her hair in pigtails, and she wore a cotton jacket. Although it was spring, this early spring morning was still a bit chilly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She was a beautiful girl who seemed like an adorable doll, with her jade-like face and her crescent eyebrows. Her eyes were the perfect proportion of white and black.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Little Yan, why have you run over here? Look, you dirtied your jacket. Aren&rsquo;t you afraid your mom will spank you?&rdquo; The suntanned man immediately smiled, looking at the little girl with love. Even his tiredness was swept away by her arrival.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Mom won&rsquo;t hit me. I came here to bring dad some fruit! Aiya!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Careful!&rdquo; the suntanned man cried out. The embankment was very muddy, and the girl slipped and fell. Those two fruits she was carrying fell into the mud, and even her dress was dirtied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She immediately began to bawl. The man hastily ran over and wiped her dress a few times. Picking her up, he placed her on a larger rock to the side of the embankment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Little Yan, what hurts? Tell dad,&rdquo; he said, worriedly looking at her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry dad, Little Yan is too stupid. I got the fruit dirty&hellip;&rdquo; Little Yan cried, obviously feeling both embarrassed and angry from having her good deed ruined.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hearing that, the man immediately relaxed and smiled. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s so dirty about them?&rdquo; The man directly dug the two fruits from the mud, wiped them a few times, and then took a big bite.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dad, they&rsquo;re dirty! Mom said that if you eat dirty things, they&rsquo;ll grow insects inside your stomach! I&rsquo;ll go wash them in the river!&rdquo; cried the girl.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Haha, that&rsquo;s something that will only happen to children. Your dad&rsquo;s stomach is strong and he can eat them without worry!&rdquo; The man patted his chest confidently.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Really? Dad is amazing!&rdquo; The girl actually believed him and looked at him worshipfully.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Come, give dad a hug. Dad will bring you home and have your mom change your clothes. If you&rsquo;re so dirty, you won&rsquo;t look like a little fairy.&rdquo; The man took off his outer clothes and lifted the girl. He was afraid of getting the girl&rsquo;s clothes dirty. He clearly doted on her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dad, am I holding up your work?&rdquo; she asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Of course not. I&rsquo;ve already worked for a while and I needed a break. Let alone your dad, even the oxen need a rest,&rdquo; comforted the man.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dad really is the best!&rdquo; The girl leaned over to kiss him on the cheek.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. Your dad is dirty, so you can&rsquo;t kiss him. If you eat any dirt, bugs will grow in your stomach!&rdquo; The man hastily dodged with a laugh.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll wait until dad is clean!&rdquo; The girl hung onto his neck.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Carrying the girl, the man crossed the farmland and arrived on the path to return to the village.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Hey, Leng Erhei, this girl of yours has such pale skin. It&rsquo;s a completely different color from yours. It couldn&rsquo;t be that your wife wasn&rsquo;t loyal to you, right?&rdquo; joked a fellow farmer who was busy in the fields when he saw them passing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These farmers all liked to joke around, and in truth, they were very close to each other. This joke didn&rsquo;t harbor any ill intent. They were all used to it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Screw off. You and your wife are both so pale, but your child looks like he is made of mud. I heard that he fell once, and it was impossible to tell him apart from the ground. It was only the next day that you found him. You&rsquo;re clearly just jealous,&rdquo; laughed the man who had been called Leng Erhei.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Hehe, my second son is two years older than your girl. Those ages just happen to be suitable. What do you think about setting them up?&rdquo; That farmer&rsquo;s eyebrows rolled several times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about it. This girl of mine is like a heavenly fairy. But your son really is not bad. He&rsquo;ll definitely be a capable hunter in the future.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be invisible once he&rsquo;s tossed to the ground, and even prey won&rsquo;t notice him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Hahaha.&rdquo; Leng Erhei laughed and left, bringing his daughter into the village.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The village wasn&rsquo;t very large. There were only a few dozen households. They lived off the land, relying entirely on farming, hunting, and gathering.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once the two of them arrived, a few women looking after children immediately smiled toward them, praising the girl for being smart and attractive. Although they often saw her, it always felt like it wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The girl was also very adorable, cutely calling them third aunt, second aunt, and so on. These villagers lived simple and honest lives here, and they all got along with each other.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aiya, my little girl, what happened to you? Are you alright?&rdquo; A woman immediately walked over upon seeing them. Seeing her current appearance, she was both angered and distressed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine. She just fell down and got her clothes dirty. Why don&rsquo;t you go ask mom to change your clothes? I&rsquo;ll get back to work.&rdquo; Leng Erhei rubbed the girl&rsquo;s head and then left.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The girl&rsquo;s mother brought out a set of clean clothes for Little Yan. She had just helped her change into them when the sound of rapid hoofbeats rang out along with several startled cries.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What are you doing?!&rdquo; Leng Erhei was amongst them. But after a muffled groan, his voice was cut off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Little Yan, don&rsquo;t move. Mom will go out to take a look.&rdquo; Little Yan&rsquo;s mother hastily ran out of the courtyard to see over ten black-robed men.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each of them was large and stocky, and they were currently shouting something. Little Yan&rsquo;s mother quickly saw Leng Erhei on the ground.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Erhei!&rdquo; cried Little Yan&rsquo;s mother.
